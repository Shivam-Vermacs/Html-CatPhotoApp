# Html-CatPhotoApp
This repository contains the code for CatPhotoApp, a mini web project inspired by the FreeCodeCamp.org web development tutorial. The HTML document showcases cat photos, lists things cats love and hate, and includes a cat-themed quiz. I followed the FreeCodeCamp tutorial, making minor modifications to personalize the project. The main sections include Cat Photos, Cat Lists, and a Cat QnA quiz. Feel free to explore the project and contribute. I created this as part of my learning journey, combining the tutorial's guidance with my own tweaks. For more details, check out the code and have fun exploring the world of CatPhotoApp!
